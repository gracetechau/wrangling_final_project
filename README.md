## Project Description

This project combines box office revenue data from the Kaggle dataset _'Movies Box Office Collection Data 2000-2024'_ and movie rating data scraped from the film review website Letterboxd from the years 2017 to 2019. The goal of combining these data sources is to determine if there is a relationship between a film's box office revneue and average rating on Letterboxd.

**To-Do List**  
[X] Clean box office revenue data  
[X] Scrape Letterboxd movie rating data  
[X] Clean Letterboxd movie rating data  
[X] Merge box office revenue and Letterboxd movie data
[X] Complete EDA and analysis on final dataset

## What did I learn?

This project developed my overall understanding and use of the Python langauge. Specifically, the use of the Selenium package when scraping data from the Letterboxd website. This project required a lot of patience and troublshooting while scraping and analyzing data. This was extremely useful in my development of using Python.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone this repository to local computer
2. Install Anaconda and run Jupyter Notebooks in numerical order
3. In-depth explanation of analysis and code in final report PDF
